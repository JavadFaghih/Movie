## Building and Running

You'll need a few things before we get started. 
Make sure you have Xcode v 12+ installed from the App Store.
also this app will run on iOS 14+.
Then run the following command to install Xcode's command line tools, if you don't have that yet

```sh
resolve package dependencies
```
